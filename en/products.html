            AGVs are used in places such as factories or warehouses where logistics transportation is required. They navigate routes with the help of guide wires, devices, or other means, and communicate with other devices to safely transport and load/unload goods along the optimal path.

            AMRs are used in places like factories or warehouses where logistics transportation is required. Unlike AGVs, they do not require guidance devices and can autonomously recognize obstacles, navigating along the optimal path.

This includes optimizing the placement, quantity, and channels of access points (APs), predicting potential issues such as signal degradation, channel interference, and other issues through simulations. By simulating and identifying areas with low signal sensitivity, known as shadow zones, and provide solutions to resolve connectivity issues effectively.

                    Taking into account the characteristics of AGVs/AMRs communicating via a wireless network, Hanwha Robotics ensure the optimal network setup for seamless operation of the AGVs/AMRs. This includes optimizing the placement, quantity, and channels of access points (APs), predicting potential issues such as signal degradation, channel interference, and other issues through simulations. By simulating and identifying areas with low signal sensitivity, known as shadow zones, and provide solutions to resolve connectivity issues effectively.

                Hanwha Robotics AGV/AMRs utilize components certified by UL (Underwriters Laboratories Inc.) in the United States and CE (Conformité Européenne) certification in Europe. Additionally, the final products obtain safety certifications of the countries importing the products.

              <p>
                Moreover, the built-in safety system is certified according to international standards such as ISO (International Organization for Standardization), PL (Performance Level), and SIL (Safety Integrity Level). The safety controller, responsible for safety functions, utilizes not only three emergency stop buttons but also a safety laser scanner to detect obstacles. It sends STO (Safety Torque Off) signals to the motors based on information from the safety encoder to monitor and adjust speed.<br/>
                <br/>
                The SLS (Safely Limited Speed) function establishes virtual safety zones, reducing speed or stopping when entering areas near designed paths to prevent safety accidents.
